# ublock-origin-search-filters

ublock origin filters to remove bad/shady/translated/spam urls from search engines results

In ublock-origin, go to the "Filter lists" tab, then in "custom" click "import", paste this URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gmolveau/ublock-origin-search-filters/master/combined.txt` and finally click on "Apply changes".

`generate.sh` is a bash script to generate the custom filters (google, duckduckgo) from the urls.txt file.
